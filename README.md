# DocProof Frontend

Frontend-only hackathon implementation for **DocProof**.

> Your code has tests. Your documentation should too.

DocProof verifies whether documentation claims still match repository evidence. This frontend demonstrates the complete user experience with deterministic mock data while remaining ready for a later FastAPI + IBM Bob 2.0 integration.

## Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router
- Plain CSS with design tokens

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite normally opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run test:logic
npm run build
```

## Demo workflow

1. Open `/`.
2. Click **Try Demo Repository**.
3. Click **Run Verification**.
4. Watch the deterministic verification workflow.
5. Review the Dashboard and Trust Score.
6. Open a failed Documentation Contract such as `DP-001`.
7. Inspect repository evidence.
8. Click **Review Fix**.
9. Click **Approve & Re-verify**.
10. Watch the contract change from failed to passed and the Trust Score increase.

## Routes

- `/` Project Setup
- `/verify` Verification Running
- `/dashboard` Overview Dashboard
- `/contracts` Documentation Contracts
- `/contracts/:id` Contract Detail
- `/contracts/:id/fix` Human Approval / Diff
- `/contracts/:id/reverified` Re-verification Result
- `/issues` Issues & Fixes
- `/trust-score` Documentation Trust Score
- `/history` Verification History

## Backend integration later

The app currently runs entirely from frontend state and deterministic mock data.

When the FastAPI backend is ready, configure:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

`src/api/client.ts` is already prepared for the planned endpoints:

- `GET /contracts`
- `GET /contracts/{id}`
- `POST /verify`
- `POST /approve/{id}`
- `POST /reject/{id}`
- `GET /trust-score`

The shared `DocumentationContract` type lives in `src/types.ts` and mirrors the project architecture contract.
