"""Re-verification Subagent.

Applies approved ``FixSuggestion`` objects to a set of ``DocumentationContract``
records, then re-runs the full verification pipeline (Runtime, Commands,
Config/Env, API) against the updated repository state.

The agent works in three phases:

1. **Apply** — For each approved fix, the contract it targets is updated
   in-memory: ``expected`` is reconciled to the corrected value, ``actual``
   is re-stated from the fix, and ``reverified`` is set to ``True``.  The
   approval bookkeeping fields (``approved``, ``approvalStatus``) are also
   marked.  No real filesystem writes happen here; the authoritative source
   of truth for file changes lives outside this agent.

2. **Re-run pipeline** — Each of the four verification agents is invoked
   against ``repo_path``.  Their fresh contract lists are merged into a
   single flat list.

3. **Summarise** — A ``ReverificationResult`` containing the merged
   contract list and a ``VerificationSummary`` is returned.  Every
   contract that was targeted by an approved fix is guaranteed to have
   ``reverified=True`` in the output, and the summary counts reflect the
   *post-fix* state.
